# Amanda's React Boilerplate
Created a simple template for getting React projects using Babel, Webpack, and Airbnb Style Guide. This way, I don't need to rewrite the exact same config files everytime I want to build a new React project. 

## Getting Started

* npm install
* npm run compile
* npm start
