# Listen to Nature Observations
This application allows users to filter and visualize observations using the iNaturalist Node API. Best of all, it comes with built in audio so you can listen to each observation. 

## Getting Started

1. Make sure that you have Node v8 or higher installed.
2. Run `npm install` in order to install all dependencies listed in package.json.
3. Run `npm run compile` to bundle React components using Webpack. 
4. Finally, run `npm start` to see the app locally at `http://localhost:3002`.

## The App

Use the selection menu to filter observations by geolocation, native species, threatened species, popular observations, and research quality-grade observations.

You can also click the last page and next page buttons to load more results. 

Try clicking multiple audio clips at once to hear the true sound of nature!
